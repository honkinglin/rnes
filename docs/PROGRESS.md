# RNES Project Progress

## Completed Features

### M0: CPU Ready ✅
- [x] 6502 CPU core architecture
- [x] Status flag implementation
- [x] Basic instruction set (BRK, ADC, LDA, STA, JMP)
- [x] Addressing mode implementation
- [x] Memory access trait design
- [x] Interrupt handling (NMI, IRQ)
- [x] Stack operations
- [x] Cycle counting

### Core Architecture ✅
- [x] Workspace multi-crate design
- [x] Shared types and error handling
- [x] Bus implementation
- [x] Emulator core logic
- [x] Cartridge and ROM parsing
- [x] Native frontend framework

### Testing and Validation ✅
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Integration tests
- [x] Demo program execution

## Current Status

### Runtime Status
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ Native frontend can run
- ✅ CPU can execute basic instructions
- ✅ Memory access trait works correctly

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ Memory mapping needs further validation
- ⚠️ Only a few instructions implemented (needs expansion)
- ⚠️ Missing PPU, APU, Mapper implementations

## Next Steps

### M1: PPU Background Rendering + NROM
- [ ] PPU timing model
- [ ] Background rendering
- [ ] NROM Mapper
- [ ] Palette system

### M2: Sprite Layer & Input
- [ ] Sprite rendering
- [ ] OAM DMA
- [ ] Input handling
- [ ] Sprite 0 hit

### M3: APU Audio
- [ ] Audio channel implementation
- [ ] Mixing system
- [ ] Audio output

## Technical Highlights

1. **Modular Design**: Clear module separation using Rust workspace
2. **Trait Abstraction**: Avoid circular dependencies through MemoryAccess trait
3. **Error Handling**: Complete error types and Result handling
4. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit tests and integration tests
5. **Logging System**: Debugging and monitoring using tracing

## Performance Metrics

- Build time: ~1-2 seconds
- Test runtime: <1 second
- Memory usage: Minimal (basic data structures only)

## Code Quality

- Code checking with clippy
- Following Rust best practices
- Complete documentation and comments
- Type-safe API design
