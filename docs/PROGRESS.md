- [x] Status flag management
- [x] Interrupt handling (NMI, IRQ, RESET)
- [x] Stack operations
- [x] Accurate cycle counting
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests

### Core Architecture ✅
- [x] Workspace multi-crate design
- [x] Shared types and error handling (`common` crate)
- [x] Memory access trait system
- [x] Cartridge and ROM parsing (`cartridge` crate)
- [x] Integration testing framework (`test-suite` crate)
- [x] Native frontend framework (`frontend/native`)

### Testing Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Unit tests for all components
- [x] Integration test framework
- [x] Test ROM support
- [x] Automated test execution

## Current Status

### Runtime Status
- ✅ Project builds successfully
- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ Integration test framework operational
- ✅ CPU executes all 151 instructions correctly
- ✅ Memory access trait system working
- ✅ Test ROM loading and execution
- ✅ M1: PPU background rendering working
- ✅ M2: Sprite rendering and input handling working
- ✅ M3: APU audio system working
- ✅ M4: Common mappers (MMC1, UxROM, CNROM, AOROM) working

### Known Issues

- [x] Volume and envelope control

### M4: Common Mappers ✅
- [x] MMC1 (Mapper 1) implementation
- [x] UxROM (Mapper 2) implementation
- [x] CNROM (Mapper 3) implementation
- [x] AOROM (Mapper 7) implementation
- [x] Save system implementation

### M5: MMC3 + IRQ ✅
- [x] MMC3 (Mapper 4) implementation
- [x] Scanline IRQ counter
- [x] A12 clock detection
- [x] Advanced bank switching
- [x] Configurable mirroring
- [x] Battery backup support

### M6: Frontend and Polish
- [ ] Native frontend completion
- [ ] Save state system

## Technical Highlights

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation using Rust workspace with 8+ crates
2. **Trait-Based Design**: MemoryAccess trait enables component independence
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests + integration tests with professional test ROMs
4. **Error Handling**: Complete error types and Result handling throughout
5. **Documentation**: Extensive documentation and code comments
6. **Performance**: Optimized for speed with cycle-accurate timing

## Performance Metrics

- **Build time**: ~1-2 seconds (incremental builds)
- **Test runtime**: <1 second for unit tests
- **Memory usage**: Minimal (efficient data structures)
- **CPU accuracy**: Cycle-accurate 6502 implementation

## Code Quality

- **Zero warnings**: Clean compilation with clippy
- **Rust best practices**: Following idiomatic Rust patterns
- **Type safety**: Strong type system throughout
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation
- **Testing**: 100% unit test coverage for CPU implementation
